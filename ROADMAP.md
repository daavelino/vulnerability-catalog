# Vulnerability-Catalog Project's Roadmap:


1. Create the **add/detail/edit/delete** ([the CRUD function set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)) vulnerability pages to substitute admin/catalog/vulnerability/add and introducing edit/delete features.

>Acceptable when catalog/vulnerability/add/ substitutes admin/catalog/vulnerability/add and the functions Read, Update and Delete be implemented.

Status: **DONE**.

---

2. Add a login page to substitute admin page login.

>Acceptable when it log users properly and all non authenticated pages redirect correct to it.

Status: **DONE**.

---

3. Add User permissions to add, change and delete a vulnerability.

>Acceptable when permissions work per user profile.

Status **DONE**.

---

4. Create a database filter that returns json data accepting parameters by url.

>Acceptable when database searchs return json objects to be used by d3 charts.

Status **DONE**.

---

5. Create a home page where users could land at first contact with vulnerability-catalog.

>Acceptable when users land at home page and get instructions about how to use it.

Status: **DONE**.

---
6. Create a search function to look for vulnerabilities in detail.

>Acceptable when a search function be integrated to the framework and vulnerabilities be returned properly.

Status: **DONE**.

--- 
7. Desing the charts using [Data-Driven Documents (d3js)](https://d3js.org) that should be present at /catalog/panorama/ using (possibly) catalog/data/json/alldatabase/ json data.

>Acceptable when Perimeter, Risk Level, Top Systems by vulnerabilities number, Top category by vulnerabilities number, systems and vulnerabilities number relation and Found/Solved metrics could be present by using d3 charts.

Status: **DONE**.

--- 

8. Insert the cvss v3 calculator code into add vulnerability page to compute and fill the Cvss score field.

>Acceptable when Base Score Metrics code could be inserted into add page and the cvss score calculation provides the v3-calculator (Basic Score Metrics) to fill 'Cvss score' field with [0-10] value properly.

Please, refer to

https://www.first.org/cvss/use-design and

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator

Status: **DONE**. Now calculators load data direct into the form inputs.

---

9. Create a Risk calculator (like Cvss calculator) to help users to evaluate risks properly. It must be inserted at catalog/vulnerability/add/ form to compute and fill the Risk field. The idea is that users can use a common risk base to evaluate vulnerabilities risks properly.

>Acceptable when an acceptable common Risk base could be designed and implemented properly to fill Risk fields with High, Medium or Low values. It must be simple to use (require just few clicks) and not redirect to any other page.

Status: **DONE**. Now calculators load data direct into the form inputs.

---


10. Review project models.py to ensure that catalog/data/json/alldatabase/ generate the best possible json file. It seems that it is possible to relate data field accordingly and create a better structured database model (and so a better json file) to fill usage expectations.

>Acceptable when all duplicated fiels where removed from catalog/data/json/alldatabase/ response and a better structured json data could be provided.

Status: **DONE**. It is using Django defaults to generate json files, so there is nothing to be done except add users table to alldatabases json, but it is out of scope of this target.


---

11. Provide a view to import external data as a json file.

>Acceptable when there is a mechanism (with a form to input json files) to import data from external sources.

Status: **DONE**. Now we can add data by creating a json file and update it properly. An example of the json structure was provided at catalog/resources/upload/ template.

---

12. Provide a guided way to insert categories at catalog/vulnerability/add form. It have to present users with [Owasp categories list](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Vulnerability) as well as custom categories present into the database.

>Acceptable when a guide function be presented to the users showing suggested and used categories and fill category form properly.

Status: **DISMISSED**. Â This feature could restrict categorization generality, so it is better just to point to OWASP categories documentation as an illustrative reference.

---

13. Design a 404 template and redirect all not found requests to that.

>Acceptable when all not found requests redirect to the desired page.

Status: **DISMISSED**.  It will be added after we work better with Catalog's visual identity.

---

14. Ensure a minimalistic and easy-to-use desing to the project.

>Acceptable when project minimize user's interaction and all features could be beautiful and meaningful to use.

Status: **DONE**.  We'll wait for more feedback regarding this issue.

---

15. Add support to other databases other than SQLite.

>Acceptable when MySQL/Mariadb, Oracle and PostgreSQL support could be choosen at installation process.

Status: **DONE**.  Added support to all refered databases.

---

16. Check project code against Python coding etiquete [(PEP -- 8 Style Guide)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

>Acceptable when all code was reviewed and following Style Guide as much as it can.

Status: **DONE**.

---

17. Check security and usability issues to enable web usage, probably by using https://snyk.io or some related tool and an independent Pentest consulting firm.

>Acceptable when project pass against pentests and vulnerability assessments.

Status: **DONE**.

---

18. Create/Update project's documentation.

>Acceptable when the main functions have been documentated properly.

Status: **Working in progress**.
