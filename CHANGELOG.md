```
vulnerability-catalog-2.0.0rc1
```

**Changes since the previous release:**

- Add Critical risk level to evaluate risks more accurately.

- Adding tools/nessus2catalog.py script to convert CSV Nessus's exports into Catalog's JSON massive uploads.

- Fixing permission schemas to allow more control of what users can do.

- Improving some Views methods for better performance and code readability.

- Improving setup.py behavior.

- Introduced a new engine to export Catalog data easily. 

- Vulnerability model now comes with meaningful default values. If you don't specify some of the optional values, it will be filled by meaningful data, instead of blank.

- Risk fields have a 'Not evaluated' default value. It means that it does not need to be present when vulnerability is catalogued. So you can omit and evaluate it later.

- Fixing some typo mistakes at detail templates.

- Fixing some layout behavior at Home, Panorama and index pages.

- Adding new CVSS 3.0 score chart at Panorama.

- Adding 'Not evaluated' risk alert to the Home page."

- Risk and CVSS calculators are now filling the calculated fields in the Add, Update and Fast Update forms.

- Improving Massive Update check against malformed files.

- Improving run.bat/run.sh start scripts to allow passing other urls than localhost:8000. Just do

```
run.bat/run.sh <fqdn/ip address>:<port>
```
to launch Catalog using a different address:port. But, you need to config base/settings.py first.

- Changing redirection after Add/Update/Fast update/Delete vulnerabilities. Now, it points back to Index view, for better usability.

- Adding text editor at Add/Update pages.

- Adding testDataGenerator.py script to create random test data.
