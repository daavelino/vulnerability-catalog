**Changes since the previous release:**

- Introduced a new engine to backup VC easily. As admin, just point to 

```
/catalog/vulnerability/data/json/backup
```

and get all data required to recover system properly.

- Vulnerability model now comes with meaningful default values. If you don't specify some of the optional values, it will be filled by meaningful data, instead of blank.

- Risk fields have a 'Not evaluated' default value. It means that it does not need to be present when vulnerability is catalogued. So you can omit and evaluate it later.

- Fixing some typo mistakes at detail templates.

- Fixing some layout behavior at Home, Panorama and index pages.

- Adding 'Not evaluated' risk alert to the Home page."
