Welcome to Vulnerability Catalog project, a catalog for Information Security Management designed for environments with **multiple or diffuse vulnerability-related information sources**.

Vulnerability catalog is a WEB application written in Python/Django/D3 providing a **visual, organized, centralized and easy-to-use catalog** that act as an --unique point of control-- to the vulnerabilities management efforts.

By providing a way to produce the same measurement basis for all vulnerabilities, risks and severities can be evaluated more accuratedly, **without the inherent biases derived from the providers' evaluation**. Be your environment evaluated by meaningful and useful metrics. That's the idea.

It can also be used as a **roadmap** and a **timeline** to treat vulnerabilities in a more efficient way, keeping track of all environment status and efforta progresses. 

By the way, take a look at the [project's Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for updates and more details.

You can also chech our [Wiki](https://github.com/daavelino/vulnerability-catalog/wiki) to documentation and more information.

# Running development branch into your box
You can run Vulnerability Catalog at **Windows** or **Linux** systems. **Android** is also supported, provided you install [Termux](https://termux.com) app. It acts like a Linux terminal, so all Linux steps apply exactly the same way as in Linux setup. 

You'll just need a Linux terminal (Termux is a Linux terminal) or the cmd.exe command line (the Windows terminal).

1. Get the files by [downloading it from GitHub](https://github.com/daavelino/vulnerability-catalog/archive/master.zip).

    1.1 If you are interesting in develop or contribute with some feature, you can clone the project by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/daavelino/vulnerability-catalog.git

```


2. Run the installer:

Under the project's directory, run

```sh
python setup.py build
```

This procedure will install Vulnerability Catalog under a [Python Virtual Enviroment.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to avoid system´s pollution. 

Once installed, run it by typing:

```sh
python setup.py run
```

>Hint: If you are interesting in see how catalog works with non-production data, load some test data here by running

```sh
python setup.py loadtestdata
```

3. Follow the instructions to [provide systems' dependencies](https://github.com/daavelino/vulnerability-catalog/wiki/Install-development-version#requirements) and point your browser to

>http://localhost:8000/catalog


# Tips for developers

The project has 2 scripts to make development processes a bit easier.

1. setup.py:

**setup.py** is responsible to set all Django required files and start the Catalog project and app properly. For instance, to build the project from the scratch, run

```sh
python setup.py build
```

This command sets Django properly and run the project into your box. It will also **load the project with a ficticious database** to help you to understand better how it works.

The command
```sh
python setup.py urlsviews
```

updates catalog app urls and views without rebuild the entire project. To update only the visual part of the project, try

```sh
python setup.py templatesonly
```

It will update catalog _templates, forms and static files_ without rebuild the entire project.

2. run.py

**run.py** is the project's launcher script, once the Catalog is already installed.


### Combining setup.py and run.py:

If you made some minor change, like a template update or a url/view change, instead of rebuild the entire project (and add your users again, log into the app and so one) just try:

```
python setup.py templatesonly
```

or

```
python setup.py urlsviews
```

and then

```
python run.py
```
It will update your changes without reconstruct everything again.

## Motivation

The idea to start this effort came from my experience trying to keep track of vulnerabilities during the Olympic and Paralympic Games at Rio 2016 - The Rio de Janeiro Olympics. During that time, I realized three important things concerning vulnerability management:

1. it is hard to **centralize all information** we got from vulnerability reports, assessments, pentests, user/peers report in a consistent way.
2. it is hard to put **relevant information**, like risks and severity, **in a common (and normalized) base**.
3. it is hard to **visualize and get insights** about the enviroment **when we have multiple and diffuse sources of data**, comming from .pdf, .xslx, .doc files or even by e-mail or other channels.

So, Vulnerability catalog emerges trying to address and make things like that a little bit easier. With Catalog, we can unify, put data into a normal basis and manage vulnerabilities better than if you try to do this by using sheets or reading reports one-by-one each time.
