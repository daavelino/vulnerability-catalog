Welcome to Vulnerability Catalog project, a catalog for Information Security Management designed for environments with **multiple or diffuse vulnerability-related information sources**.

>[Check the latest release](https://github.com/daavelino/vulnerability-catalog/releases)

[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/daavelino/vulnerability-catalog/badge.svg?targetFile=requirements.txt)](https://snyk.io/test/github/daavelino/vulnerability-catalog?targetFile=requirements.txt)
[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/79aebad49ab08c14656c/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/daavelino/vulnerability-catalog/maintainability)


### Install & run the Catalog
```sh
git clone https://github.com/daavelino/vulnerability-catalog
cd vulnerability-catalog
./setup.sh    # only during the first install
./run.sh
```

* Test the Catalog by [importing a testing dataset](https://github.com/daavelino/vulnerability-catalog/wiki/Running-the-Catalog-with-testing-data).

### Features

* Consistent track of the entire vulnerability lifecycle in a single place.
* Standardized description and quantification of the vulnerabilities.
* Risk and severity calculators to support precise quantification.
* Dashboard to visualize the progress and attention points.
* Easily import of the vulnerabilities found by Nessus or OpenVAS.

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/daavelino/vulnerability-catalog/wiki) for more information.

### Why a Catalog?
Storing and keep track of all vulnerabilities found on your environment by using a centralized, easy to use and organized catalogue is a way more secure than using the traditional spreadsheets.

With the Panorama, gain insights about what needs to be improved, track progress and effort, design better strategies and reduce risks by visualising the environment as a whole.

### Motivation

The idea to start this effort came from my experience trying to keep track of vulnerabilities during the Olympic and Paralympic Games at Rio 2016 - The Rio de Janeiro Olympics. During that time, I realized three hard things about vulnerability management:

1. it is hard to **centralize all information** we got from vulnerability reports, assessments, pentests, user/peers report in a consistent way.
2. it is hard to put **relevant information**, like risks and severity, **in a common (and normalized) base**.
3. it is hard to **visualize and get insights** about the enviroment **when we have multiple and diffuse sources of data**, comming from .pdf, .xslx, .doc files or even by e-mail or other channels.

So, Vulnerability Catalog try to make things a little bit easier. With Catalog, we can unify, put data into a normal basis and manage vulnerabilities better than if you try to do this by using sheets or search and reading reports one-by-one each time you need an information.

## Deploying to production
