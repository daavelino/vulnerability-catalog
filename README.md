Welcome to Vulnerability Catalog project, a catalog for Information Security Management designed for environments with **multiple or diffuse vulnerability-related information sources**.

Vulnerability catalog is a WEB application written in Python/Django/JavaScript that offers a **visual, organized, centralized and easy-to-use vulnerability management** tool that act as a single point of control of the vulnerabilities found at your environment. The idea is to consolidate all the reported vulnerabilities, keep track of their lifecycle (discovery, risk analysis and treatment) and, by providing a **panoramic view of the environment status** and **get insights** about how to reduce risks while **reducing the traditional vulnerability management overhead**.

By providing a way to relate all vulnerabilities using the same measurement basis, business risks and vulnerabilities severities can be calculated more accurately, **removing the inherent biases derived from the providers' evaluation**.

It also offers a Panorama for **insights about what need to be improved**, to reduce development mistakes, **design better strategies, reduce risks** and keeping track of all environment status and effort progresses by acting as a visual **roadmap** and a **timeline** to vulnerabilities management efforts.

By the way, take a look at the [project's Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and [projects](https://github.com/daavelino/vulnerability-catalog/projects) for updates and more details about what is going on.

You can also chech our [Wiki](https://github.com/daavelino/vulnerability-catalog/wiki) to documentation and more information.

# Running Catalog

To run a full version of the Catalog, do:

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/daavelino/vulnerability-catalog/releases).
2. Run the installer:

Under the project's directory, run

```sh
python setup.py build
```

This procedure will install Vulnerability Catalog under a [Python Virtual Enviroment.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to avoid system´s pollution. 

>Hint: If you are interesting in see how catalog works with non-production data, load some test data here by running

```sh
python setup.py loadtestdata
```

Once installed, run the Catalog by typing:

At Linux:
```sh
./run.sh
```

At Windows:
```sh
run.bat
```

3. Point your browser to

>http://localhost:8000/catalog


# Running development branch into your box
You can run Vulnerability Catalog at **Windows** or **Linux** systems. **Android** is also supported, provided you install [Termux](https://termux.com) app. It acts like a Linux terminal, so all Linux steps apply exactly the same way as in Linux setup. 

You'll just need a Linux terminal (Termux is a Linux terminal) or the cmd.exe command line (the Windows terminal).

1. Get the files by [downloading it from GitHub](https://github.com/daavelino/vulnerability-catalog/archive/master.zip).

    1.1 If you are interesting in develop or contribute with some feature, you can clone the project by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/daavelino/vulnerability-catalog.git
```

2. Run the installer:

Under the project's directory, run

```sh
python setup.py build
```

This procedure will install Vulnerability Catalog under a [Python Virtual Enviroment.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to avoid system´s pollution. 

Once installed, run the Catalog by typing:

At Linux:
```sh
./run.sh
```

At Windows:
```sh
run.bat
```

# Tips for developers

The project has 2 scripts to make development processes a bit easier.

1. setup.py:

**setup.py** is responsible for set all Django required files and start the Catalog project and app properly. To check all its options, just call it without any parameters:

```sh
python setup.py
```

For instance, to build the project from the scratch, run

```sh
python setup.py build
```
This command sets Django properly and run the project into your box. 

If you are interesting in **load the project with some ficticious data** you could try after

```sh
python setup.py loadtestdata
```

The command
```sh
python setup.py urlsviews
```

updates catalog app urls and views without rebuild the entire project. To update only the visual part of the project, try

```sh
python setup.py templatesonly
```

It will update catalog _templates, forms and static files_ without rebuild the entire project.

2. run.sh/run.bat

**run.sh** and **run.bat** simplify the ask of loading the virtual environment and run the Catalog. Instead of remember all those steps to run the project properly, since call it from your OS terminal.


### Combining setup.py and run.sh/run.bat:

If you made some minor change, like a template update or a url/view change, instead of rebuild the entire project (and add your users again, log into the app and so one) just try:

```
python setup.py templatesonly
```

or

```
python setup.py urlsviews
```

and then

```
./run.sh (or run.bat)
```
It will update your changes without reconstruct everything again.

## Motivation

The idea to start this effort came from my experience trying to keep track of vulnerabilities during the Olympic and Paralympic Games at Rio 2016 - The Rio de Janeiro Olympics. During that time, I realized three important things concerning vulnerability management:

1. it is hard to **centralize all information** we got from vulnerability reports, assessments, pentests, user/peers report in a consistent way.
2. it is hard to put **relevant information**, like risks and severity, **in a common (and normalized) base**.
3. it is hard to **visualize and get insights** about the enviroment **when we have multiple and diffuse sources of data**, comming from .pdf, .xslx, .doc files or even by e-mail or other channels.

So, Vulnerability catalog emerges trying to address and make things like that a little bit easier. With Catalog, we can unify, put data into a normal basis and manage vulnerabilities better than if you try to do this by using sheets or reading reports one-by-one each time.
